                    <p>First and foremost, this is my personal website that I've been working on for 2 decades now, constantly trying to perfect. I started dabbling in code in high school when a friend turned me onto it. I've been working on this website since then, so to speak, creating and recreating many different versions. I'm hoping this will be a "final" major version. Now, finally, I have my personal collection of projects and hobbies all in once place.  </p>

                    <p> <b>An explanation of my pseudonames (under image).</b> </p> <br>
                    <p> <b>Infusca</b> is my goto name for anything gaming or coding related. I made up the name for my first main World of Warcraft character. She was an undead rogue and I was trying to find a word that meant dark, or black, or something of the sort. I found "infusco", which means <i> to darken or obscure </i>, in latin.</i> I took it upon myself to create a 'feminine' version of it and changed the "o" an "a". </p> <br>
                    <p> <b>Pickle</b> was something my sister used to call me sometimes, when we were kids. </p> <br>
                    <p> <b>Wolfpet4me</b> was my original username when internet first became a thing, or when we first got AOL. I still miss the days of going into the weather chatroom before school and talking to the adults in there. It was my favorite chatroom, and I still wonder about the people I met in there. </p> <br>
                    <p> In regards to the Mario comment, when my sister and I used to play super mario brothers on SNES, she was always Mario, and I was always Luigi. </p>
